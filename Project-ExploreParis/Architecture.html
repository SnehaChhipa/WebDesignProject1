                    <!-- reference = https://www.friendsofnotredamedeparis.org/notre-dame-cathedral/ -->
                    <p>Notre Dame Cathedral, sometimes referred to as Notre-Dame de Paris<br>
                        (“Our Lady of Paris”) or simply Notre Dame, stands as a testament<br>
                        to history and faith on the eastern half of Île de la Cité, an island<br>
                        in the Seine River within Paris, France’s 4th arrondissement. This<br>
                        celebrated Catholic cathedral is renowned for its stunning French<br>
                        Gothic architecture and holds a special place in the hearts of <br>
                        Parisians and visitors alike, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. <br>
                        Constructed between the 12th and 14th centuries, Notre-Dame has <br>
                        borne witness to countless historical events, wars, and <br>
                        revolutions. The cathedral’s breathtaking stained glass windows,<br>
                        elaborate stone carvings, and soaring spires, which reach heights<br>
                        of over 100 meters, have captivated millions of people worldwide.</p>

                        The Pompidou Centre was formally opened on January 31, 1977, by<br>
                        French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Pompidou Centre<br>
                        is said to resemble a huge spaceship for its style, use of colour<br>
                        and material. Its overpowering industrial-looking exterior,<br>
                        which dwarfs its surroundings, attracted notoriety for its<br>
                        brightly coloured exterior pipes, ducts, and other exposed <br>
                        services. 15 million kilos of steel was used in its construction,<br>
                        while reinforced concrete was used to cover 50,000 cubic meters of<br>
                        it. 49,212 square feet of it is covered by glass. The Pompidou <br>
                        Centre houses many separate services and activities. It's a museum<br>
                        of modern art brought under one roof. There are also frequent <br>
                        temporary exhibitions devoted to modern themes.</p>

                    <p>The Fondation Louis Vuitton is located next to the Jardin d'Acclimatation<br>
                        in the Bois de Boulogne, the famous park on the west side of Paris. <br>
                        This great architectural exploit has already taken its place among the<br>
                        iconic works of 21st-century architecture. Frank Gehry's building, is the<br>
                        reflection of the unique, creative and innovative project that is the <br>
                        Fondation Louis Vuitton. To produce his first sketches, Frank Gehry took<br>
                        his inspiration from the lightness of late 19th-century glass and garden<br>
                        architecture. The choice of materials became self-evident: an envelope <br>
                        of glass would cover the body of the building, an assembly of blocks <br>
                        referred to as the "iceberg", and would give it its volume. Placed in<br>
                        a basin specially created for the purpose, the building fits easily into <br>
                        the natural environment, between woods and garden, while at the same<br> time
                        playing with light and mirror effects.

                        venue La Seine Musicale has now opened to the public on <br>
                        Île Seguin. The most striking feature of La Seine Musicale is <br>
                        the egg-shaped auditorium made of glass and a lattice of <br>
                        timber laminate from a woven spruce wood and accessorised <br>
                        with a dynamic 800 sq m sail of photovoltaic cells, which <br>
                        shields this core from direct sunlight. This agile and <br>
                        entirely solar-powered form is mounted on rails and follows<br>
                        the path of the sun at 15 minute intervals as it progresses,<br>
                        supplying the auditorium with energy. One of the aims of the<br>
                        architects was to create a public building that would express <br>
                        permeability between interior to exterior space, allowing <br>
                        people to filter naturally through the whole site.

                    <p>The Philharmonie brings to life an ancient dream: the initial Cité<br>
                        de la Musique project included a large auditorium, intended to <br>
                        complete the round out the proposed music rooms and amphitheatre. <br>
                        A rock-like building with the air of a hill rising from the Parc<br>
                        de la Villette, the Philharmonie offers innovative forms. Its’<br>
                        brilliant spiralling aluminium forms surrounding the central<br>
                        concert hall contrast with it elegantly- angled matt envelope,<br>
                        coated in a bird mosaic in varying shades of grey. The public<br>
                        can stroll across its’ 37-metre high roof, which offers a <br>
                        panoramic view, merging the city and its’ suburbs. 52 metres<br>
                        high, the Philharmonie de Paris is a landmark in Paris’ north-east.<br>
                        The Philharmonie is also a compass point in the Parc de la Villette.<br>

                <p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 20px">
                    In 1988 the French government announced its ambition for <br>
                    the construction of one of the largest and most modern <br>
                    libraries in the world regrouping several existing <br>
                    institutions on one site. The library consists of four<br>
                    25-story glass towers and two levels of reading rooms which<br>
                    surround a garden of over one hectare located below. Book <br>
                    stores are located partly in the basement, close to the<br>
                    reading rooms, and partly in the upper floors of the towers.<br>
                    The four corner towers resemble four open books, all facing<br>
                    one another. They aim to define a symbolic place which<br>
                    imposes the library's presence and identity on the urban <br>
                    landmarks developed and enhance the idea of the "book". The<br>
                    public space offers a direct and natural physical contact<br>
                    between the sacred institution and the person in the street.<br>
                    Like a cloister, this tranquil, unruffled space invites <br>
                    contemplation and a flowering of intellectual endeavor.
