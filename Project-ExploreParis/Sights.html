        <p>The Eiffel Tower — or, La Tour Eiffel — has remained one of the world's
            most recognizable landmarks, symbolizing the romance and ingenuity of the City of Lights.
            Located in the 7th arrondissement, this immense iron monument, a true architectural
            and technical feat, is now the symbol of Paris and France for tourists from all over the
            world. The pride and joy of Parisians was quick to become the world's most visited paid
            admission monument! Many visitors queue up to discover one of the most beautiful panoramic
            views available of the city of Paris. Indeed, on the second floor there is a breathtaking
            view of Paris' buildings and monuments.</p>

        <!-- Reference= https://www.ourescapeclause.com/visiting-the-paris-catacombs-tour/ -->
        <p>
            Paris catacombs are a winding maze of tunnels that stretches deep underneath one of the most
            famous cities in the world and plays host to roughly 6 million artfully arranged human skeletons
            and with a description like that, is it any surprise that the idea of visiting the Paris catacombs
            has fascinated visitors for centuries?

        <p>
            The Sainte-Chapelle or Holy Chapel is a Gothic-style treasure box of exquisite stained glass,
            sculpture, and paintings. Built for Louis IX as a royal chapel around A.D. 1238, it’s located
            on the premises of the Palais de la Cité where French kings ruled for centuries. The Sainte-Chapelle
            is the finest royal chapel to be built in France and features a truly exceptional collection
            of stainedglass windows. It was at the heart of the royal residence, the Palais de la Cité, to
            house the relics of the Passion of Christ. Adorned with a unique collection of fifteen glass panels
            and a rose window forming a veritable wall of light, the Sainte-Chapelle is a gem of Rayonnant
            Gothic architecture.

        <p>Located at the heart of the Beaubourg district in Paris' 4th arrondissement between the
            Marais and Les Halles, not far from Rambuteau Metro station, the Centre Pompidou astounds
            visitors with its modern and unusual architecture in bright colours. It is a world-famous
            centre of art and culture. Built at the request of President Georges Pompidou to create
            an original cultural institution at the heart of the capital, today it houses the best of
            modern and contemporary art. On the 4th and 5th floors, you can thus admire a remarkable
            collection of modern art from 1905 to 1960, with works by such big names as Picasso, Matisse
            and Soulages, as well as contemporary art from 1960 to the present day, by such famous artists

        <!-- Reference = https://thetourguy.com/travel-blog/france/paris/sights-from-the-seine-your-guide-to-the-seine-river-cruise/ -->
        <p>Paris is a very walkable city which makes exploring it by foot both attractive and popular.
            That said, one of the most popular activities in Paris for visitors is taking a
            Seine River Cruise. A Seine River cruise is a little touristy but a truly amazing way
            to see Paris. You get a truly unique perspective on some of the city’s most famous sites.
            The Seine River pulls water from a little place known as “Sources de la Seine” or Source
            of the Seine. It runs all the way across France to the English Channel. Where is Sources de la
            Seine? According to Wikipedia the Seine is 775km or roughly 482 miles from the English Channel
            running almost clear across France. The source of this river is only about 171km (106mi) from
            Switzerland!</p>

        <h3>Palace of Versailles</h3>
        <!-- https://www.france.fr/en/paris/article/palace-versailles-chateau-versailles -->
        <p>One of the greatest achievements of French 17th-century art, the Palace itself contains
            a staggering 2,300 rooms, with over 100 bearing witness to the lavish luxury of the
            former royal residence, and another 100 displaying the remarkable collection of paintings
            and sculptures of the Museum of French History, created by Louis-Philippe in 1837.
            In addition to the Palace, the kings of Versailles built more intimate spaces in an attempt
            to gain some brief respite from courtly etiquette. The Grand Trianon is a spectacular
            colonnaded structure of pink marble opening onto a central courtyard. Here the Hall
            of Mirrors is particularly impressive, at 73 metres long with 357 mirrors, where courtiers
            and illustrious guests were received at the time of Louis XIV. The neo-Classical Petit
            Trianon was a home at the heart of the gardens, eventually
            given as a gift to Marie Antoinette in 1774.</p>

        <p>
            Served by the Charles de Gaulle - Étoile Metro station in the 8th arrondissement,
            the Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile is surely one of the most famous monuments in Paris.
            Built between 1806 and 1836, to honour Napoleon Bonaparte's Great Army and commemorate
            the victory at Austerlitz. At the top of the Arc de Triomphe, the panoramic terrace,
            which is reached by climbing no fewer than 248 steps, offers an untrammelled view of
            the twelve avenues that radiate outwards from the Place de l'Étoile, including the
            very famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées and the no less famous Avenue Foch. There are
            two orientation tables to help you spot the main tourist attractions in the capital.
            On your way back, take a little time to rediscover the Attic room, which contains
            sculptures as well as an exhibition on the history of the edifice.

            also displays all Western artistic creation from 1848 to 1914. Its collections represent

            arts and photography. You're sure to be dazzled by the beauty of the place: a train
